## RecipEasy - final project for Lighthouse Labs bootcamp
created by Jonathan Archer and Simon Garber

A web app that uses an API to pull searched recipes, and then cross references those recipes with ingredients that the user has on hand, resulting in a list of needed ingredients that the user requires to make the recipe.

## Tech used

- RoR API (backend)
- React (frontend)
- PostgreSQL (database)

## Setup

- Install depedecies with `npm install`.
- run rails server first using `rails s` from 'back_rails' directory
- run react server using `npm start` in the 'front_react_state' directory.  Select 'y' to choose another port.
- go to localhost:3001 to use application.
